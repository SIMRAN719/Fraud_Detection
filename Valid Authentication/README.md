Authentication mechanism to verify user credentials.
Access control to a secret file based on authentication status.

## Technology and Tools

* **Python:** Utilized for scripting and interacting with APIs.

* **JSON:** For Data Storage

* **Regular expressions:** For Validation Mechanism

## Requirements

**1. Python Installation:** 
Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/) from the official Python website.

**2. Required Packages:**
Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install them:

```
    pip install re
```
## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
# On Windows, use 
venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Run the authentication script:

```
python main.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to authenticate or add a new user.

## Tips

1. Environment Considerations: If you're using virtual environments, ensure to activate your environment before running the code.

2. Check Dependencies: Double-check that all dependencies and required libraries are installed and up-to-date.
